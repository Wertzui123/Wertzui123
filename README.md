### Hi, I'm Wertzui123 :wave:

I am a dedicated software developer and tech enthusiast[^1] from Germany. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
<br>My biggest project by far is [ASPL](https://github.com/aspl-lang/aspl), a simple yet powerful modern cross-platform programming language.

Besides that, I mostly use PHP, C#, and V, but also have some experience in C, JavaScript, Java, Python, and a few other languages.
<br>I'm also founder and head developer of the [WertzuiGames](https://wertzuigames.net) Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server network.

:mailbox: How to reach me: you can contact me on [Discord](https://discord.com) (@wertzui123) or send an e-mail to wertzui123@gmx.net
<br>:telescope: Iâ€™m currently working on: _many things_ (probably including ASPL :sweat_smile:)

Other notable projects of mine here on Github include:
* Many [PocketMine-MP](https://pmmp.io/) plugins, including hits like [BedrockClans](https://github.com/Wertzui123/BedrockClans), [CB-Heads](https://github.com/Wertzui123/CB-Heads) and [Rewards](https://github.com/Wertzui123/Rewards)
* [Libellus](https://github.com/Wertzui123/Libellus) - an open-source note-taking app for all your devices
* [icylib](https://github.com/Wertzui123/icylib) - a simple CPU-based image processing and manipulation library
* [PMMP5Converter](https://github.com/Wertzui123/PMMP5Converter) - automatically convert your PocketMine-MP 4 plugins to API 5
* [AppBundle](https://github.com/Wertzui123/AppBundle) - add resources to your program after its compilation
* [TLSe](https://github.com/Wertzui123/TLSe) - a V wrapper around the [TLSe C library](https://github.com/eduardsui/tlse) implementing the Transport Layer Security protocol
* [ECHTTP](https://github.com/Wertzui123/echttp) - a simple single-file HTTP(S) client library written in C
* [CWSC](https://github.com/Wertzui123/cwsc) - a bare but useful single-file WebSocket client library written in C
* [HashMap](https://github.com/Wertzui123/HashMap) - a generic hashmap implementation written in V that allows any kind of key-value-pairs
* [actions-vms](https://github.com/Wertzui123/actions-vms) - Short-living VMs abusing Github Actions for testing all kinds of things

[^1]: Well, software development is just one of the many things I spend my time on, but this Github profile is dedicated solely to my computer-related stuff.
